## 1. What Is Hangul?

**Hangul (한글)** is the writing system of Korean.  
Created in **1443** by **King Sejong**, it was designed to be **scientific, phonetic, and easy to learn**.

Hard truth: **Hangul is one of the most intelligently designed scripts in the world.**

---

## 2. Core Structure (Very Important)

Hangul does **not** work like Arabic or Latin.

- Letters are written **in blocks**, not in a straight line.
    
- Each block = **1 syllable**
    
- Structure:
    
    `(Consonant) + Vowel (+ Consonant)`
    

Example:

- 한 = ㅎ + ㅏ + ㄴ
    
- 글 = ㄱ + ㅡ + ㄹ

## 3. Consonants (자음 – ja-eum)

### Basic Consonants (14)

|Letter|Sound|Approx|
|---|---|---|
|ㄱ|g / k|go|
|ㄴ|n|no|
|ㄷ|d / t|do|
|ㄹ|r / l|light|
|ㅁ|m|man|
|ㅂ|b / p|boy|
|ㅅ|s|see|
|ㅇ|silent / ng|sing|
|ㅈ|j|jam|
|ㅊ|ch|chair|
|ㅋ|k|kite|
|ㅌ|t|top|
|ㅍ|p|pen|
|ㅎ|h|hat|

Key note:

- **ㅇ** is silent at the start, **ng** at the end.

## 4. Vowels (모음 – mo-eum)

### Basic Vowels (10)

|Letter|Sound|Approx|
|---|---|---|
|ㅏ|a|father|
|ㅑ|ya|yard|
|ㅓ|eo|cut|
|ㅕ|yeo|young|
|ㅗ|o|go|
|ㅛ|yo|yoga|
|ㅜ|u|food|
|ㅠ|yu|you|
|ㅡ|eu|no English equivalent|
|ㅣ|i|machine|

Hard truth:

- **ㅡ (eu)** is the only vowel learners struggle with. Everything else is easy.

## 5. Combined Vowels (11)

|Letter|Sound|
|---|---|
|ㅐ|ae|
|ㅔ|e|
|ㅒ|yae|
|ㅖ|ye|
|ㅘ|wa|
|ㅙ|wae|
|ㅚ|oe|
|ㅝ|wo|
|ㅞ|we|
|ㅟ|wi|
|ㅢ|ui|

You don’t memorize these blindly — they are logical **vowel merges**.

---

## 6. How Syllable Blocks Are Built

### Examples

|Block|Breakdown|Sound|
|---|---|---|
|가|ㄱ + ㅏ|ga|
|나|ㄴ + ㅏ|na|
|한|ㅎ + ㅏ + ㄴ|han|
|국|ㄱ + ㅜ + ㄱ|guk|

Rules:

- Vertical vowel → consonant on the **left**
    
- Horizontal vowel → consonant on the **top**
    
- Final consonant goes **bottom**
    

---

## 7. Double & Tense Consonants (Advanced but Important)

|Letter|Sound|
|---|---|
|ㄲ|kk|
|ㄸ|tt|
|ㅃ|pp|
|ㅆ|ss|
|ㅉ|jj|

These are **tense**, not louder. Indian learners often mispronounce these — be careful.

---

## 8. Pronunciation Reality Check

- Korean pronunciation is **consistent**
    
- No silent letters (except ㅇ)
    
- Reading Korean is **far easier than English**
    

Once you know Hangul:

> You can read Korean in **2–3 days**, even if you don’t understand it.

---

## 9. Why Korean Is Considered “Easy”

Tell-it-like-it-is answer:

- No tones (unlike Chinese)
    
- No gender (unlike Arabic, French)
    
- No complex verb conjugation at beginner level
    
- Alphabet is **finite and logical**
    

Grammar later gets tricky — **writing does not**.
