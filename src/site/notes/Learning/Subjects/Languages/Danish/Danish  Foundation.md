## 1. What Danish Is (Big Picture)

- **Language family:** North Germanic (Scandinavian)
    
- **Closest relatives:** Norwegian (Bokmål), Swedish
    
- **Writing vs speaking:** Writing is relatively logical; **spoken Danish is the real challenge** due to sound reduction.
    

Danish is often called _“easy to read, hard to hear.”_ That assessment is accurate.

---

## 2. Alphabet and Letters

Danish uses the Latin alphabet plus **three extra letters**:

|Letter|Name|Approx. Sound|
|---|---|---|
|Æ æ|æ|“a” in _cat_|
|Ø ø|ø|like French _eu_|
|Å å|å|“o” in _more_|

Alphabet order ends as: **… X, Y, Z, Æ, Ø, Å**

---

## 3. Pronunciation Core (Critical)

This is where Danish separates serious learners from casual ones.

### Key Features

- **Many letters are silent**, especially _d, g, t_
    
- **Vowel reduction** is extreme
    
- **Stød**: a glottal stop or creaky voice that changes meaning
    

Examples:

- _mad_ (food) vs _mat_ (math) → pronunciation difference is subtle
    
- _rød_ (red) → the **d is not fully pronounced**
    

You must train your ear early. Reading alone will not work.

---

## 4. Word Stress

- Stress usually falls on the **first syllable**
    
- Prefixes are often unstressed
    
- Compound words carry stress on the **first main element**
    

---

## 5. Nouns and Gender

Danish has **two genders**, not three.

|Gender|Article|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Common (fælleskøn)|en|_en bog_ (a book)|
|Neuter (intetkøn)|et|_et hus_ (a house)|

### Definite Form (Very Important)

Danish uses **suffix articles**:

- _en bog_ → _bogen_ (the book)
    
- _et hus_ → _huset_ (the house)
    

This is a Scandinavian hallmark.

---

## 6. Plurals

Plural forms vary, but patterns exist:

- _-er_: _en bil → biler_
    
- _-e_: _en pige → piger_
    
- Zero plural: _et år → år_
    

Definite plural:

- _bilerne_ (the cars)

## 7. Pronouns (Basic)

| English        | Danish    |
| -------------- | --------- |
| I              | jeg       |
| you (singular) | du        |
| he             | han       |
| she            | hun       |
| it             | den / det |
| we             | vi        |
| you (plural)   | I         |
| they           | de        |

Formal _De_ exists but is rarely used today.

---

## 8. Verbs (Simpler Than German)

Good news: **no verb conjugation by person**.

Example: _at være_ (to be)

- jeg er
    
- du er
    
- han er
    

### Tenses (Core Set)

- Present: _jeg spiser_ (I eat)
    
- Past: _jeg spiste_ (I ate)
    
- Perfect: _jeg har spist_ (I have eaten)
    
- Future: _jeg vil spise_ (I will eat)
    

Auxiliaries: **har** (have), **er** (be), **vil** (will)

---

## 9. Word Order (Extremely Important)

Danish follows **V2 (Verb-Second) rule**.

Example:

- _Jeg spiser æbler._
    
- _I dag spiser jeg æbler._
    

The verb always stays in **second position**, even if the sentence starts with time or place.

This rule is non-negotiable.

---

## 10. Negation

- _ikke_ = not  
    Placement:
    
- After the verb in simple sentences
    
    - _Jeg forstår ikke._
        

---

## 11. Prepositions

Mostly similar to English but must be memorized:

- _i_ = in
    
- _på_ = on
    
- _til_ = to
    
- _fra_ = from
    

Prepositions + articles often contract in usage.

---

## 12. Vocabulary Reality

- Many **transparent cognates** for English speakers:
    
    - _hus_ = house
        
    - _vand_ = water
        
- False friends exist:
    
    - _eventuelt_ ≠ eventually
        

---

## 13. Why Danish Feels Hard

Be blunt about it:

- Spoken Danish deletes sounds aggressively
    
- Native speakers speak fast
    
- Writing hides pronunciation
    

This is not a beginner failure—it is a language feature.

---

## 14. Best Learning Strategy

1. Learn **pronunciation + listening first**
    
2. Shadow native audio daily
    
3. Learn nouns **with gender**
    
4. Master V2 word order early
    
5. Do not overfocus on grammar tables
    

If you treat Danish like German, you will struggle. Treat it like **a sound system with grammar attached**, and progress accelerates.
