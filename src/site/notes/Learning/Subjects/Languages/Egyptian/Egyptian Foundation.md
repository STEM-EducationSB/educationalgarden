# Egyptian Foundation

## 1. What “Ancient Egyptian” Actually Is

First, clarity matters.

**Ancient Egyptian** is not one single form. It evolved over ~3,000 years.

You should think of it in **layers**:

1. **Old Egyptian** – Pyramid Texts (Old Kingdom)
    
2. **Middle Egyptian** – _Classical form_ (the standard for learning)
    
3. **Late Egyptian** – New Kingdom everyday language
    
4. **Demotic** – Highly cursive script
    
5. **Coptic** – Final stage, written in Greek letters
    

**You must start with Middle Egyptian.**  
This is non-negotiable. Every serious Egyptologist does.

## 2. Writing Systems (This Is Critical)

Ancient Egyptian is defined by its scripts, not by pronunciation.

### The Three Scripts

1. **Hieroglyphs** – Monumental, formal, symbolic
    
2. **Hieratic** – Cursive, used on papyrus
    
3. **Demotic** – Later shorthand (ignore for now)
    

You start with **hieroglyphs**, but understand this rule:

> Hieroglyphs are **not an alphabet**.  
> They are a **mixed writing system**.

### Symbol Types

|Type|Function|
|---|---|
|**Phonograms**|Sound values (1, 2, or 3 consonants)|
|**Logograms**|Whole words|
|**Determinatives**|Meaning classifiers (silent but essential)|

This is why beginners fail: they treat it like ABCD.

---

## 3. Sounds: The Brutal Truth

Ancient Egyptian **vowels are mostly unknown**.

What we reconstruct:

- Consonants (fairly well)
    
- Grammar (very well)
    
- Meaning (very well)
    

What we **cannot** fully recover:

- Exact pronunciation
    

So we use **Egyptological Pronunciation**, an academic convention.

Example:

`nfr → “nefer” (means good / beautiful)`

That “e” is artificial. Accept this early.

---

## 4. Core Grammar Concepts (Foundation Pillars)

### 1. Root-Based Language

Words are built from **consonantal roots**.  
Similar to Semitic languages (Arabic, Hebrew).

Example:

`nfr = good, beautiful`

### 2. No Tense Like Modern Languages

Instead of tense, Egyptian uses:

- **Aspect**
    
- **State**
    
- **Sentence type**
    

This is why translation feels alien at first.

### 3. Sentence Types (Very Important)

Middle Egyptian has **two core sentence systems**:

- **Verbal sentences** (action-focused)
    
- **Nominal sentences** (state/existence)
    

You must learn these separately.

---

## 5. Direction of Writing

Hieroglyphs can be written:

- Left → Right
    
- Right → Left
    
- Top → Bottom
    

Rule:

> **Always read toward the faces of humans or animals.**

This rule alone saves beginners months of confusion.

---

## 6. Determinatives: The Hidden Key

Determinatives do **not** make sound.

They clarify meaning.

Example:

`pr + house determinative = “house” pr + walking-man determinative = “to go out”`

Same consonants. Different meanings.

If you ignore determinatives, you are illiterate in Egyptian.

---

## 7. What You Should Learn First (Strict Order)

### Phase 1 – Script Literacy

- Uniliteral signs (single consonants)
    
- Common biliteral signs
    
- Determinatives categories
    

### Phase 2 – Grammar Skeleton

- Pronouns
    
- Nouns (gender, number)
    
- Adjectives
    
- Nominal sentences
    

### Phase 3 – Verbal System

- Infinitive
    
- sḏm.f form
    
- Imperative
    
- Negation
    

### Phase 4 – Real Texts

- Offering formulas
    
- Tomb inscriptions
    
- Short narrative texts
    

No apps. No Duolingo-style nonsense.

---

## 8. Mental Shift You Must Accept

You are not “learning to speak” Ancient Egyptian.

You are learning to:

- **Read**
    
- **Analyze**
    
- **Translate**
    
- **Understand how Egyptians thought**
    

If you want spoken continuity, that comes later via **Coptic**.

---

## 9. Recommended Core Resources (Serious Ones)

If you want academic-grade learning:

- **James P. Allen – _Middle Egyptian_** (gold standard)
    
- **Gardiner – _Egyptian Grammar_** (older, still authoritative)
    
- Hieroglyph sign lists (Gardiner codes)
    

If you want, I can structure these into a **week-by-week study plan**.

---

## 10. Reality Check (Important)

Ancient Egyptian is:

- Slow at first
    
- Extremely logical
    
- Deeply rewarding
    

If you build the foundation properly, everything later becomes elegant.
