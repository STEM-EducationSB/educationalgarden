# **NORWEGIAN (BOKMÅL) GRAMMAR — FULL TUTORIAL**

Norwegian grammar is surprisingly friendly: fewer verb forms, predictable rules, and a clean sentence structure. If you already know English, you’ll adapt fast.

Let’s go layer by layer.

---

# **1. The Alphabet & Pronunciation (Quick Map)**

Norwegian uses **A–Z + Æ Ø Å**.

- **Æ** = “a” in “cat”
    
- **Ø** = French “eu” (like “bleu”)
    
- **Å** = “aw” in “law”
    

Consonants are mostly like English, except:

- **J** = English “y”
    
- **G** before i/y = English “y” (like “gi” = “yee”)
    
- **K** before i/y = “sh” sound (like “kjøtt” ~ “shut” but softer)
    

---

# **2. Nouns**

Norwegian nouns have _three_ genders:

|Gender|Name|Example|Meaning|
|---|---|---|---|
|m|masculine|en gutt|a boy|
|f|feminine|ei jente|a girl|
|n|neuter|et hus|a house|

Feminine nouns **can be** used as masculine in Bokmål:  
_ei jente_ = _en jente_ (both correct)

---

## **2.1 Definite & Indefinite Forms**

### **Indefinite (a/an)**

- en mann (a man)
    
- ei bok (a book)
    
- et bord (a table)
    

### **Definite (the)**

You attach the article _to the end_ of the noun:

- mannen = the man
    
- boka / boken = the book
    
- bordet = the table
    

---

# **3. Plurals**

### **Masculine**

- en bil → biler (cars) → bilene (the cars)
    

### **Feminine**

- ei bok → bøker (books) → bøkene (the books)
    

### **Neuter**

- et hus → hus (houses) → husene (the houses)
    

Some plural patterns are irregular, but patterns are very predictable.

---

# **4. Adjectives**

## **4.1 Basic Rule**

Adjectives change based on the noun’s gender/number.

|Form|Rule|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Masculine/Feminine|basic form|en stor bil|
|Neuter|+ _t_|et stort hus|
|Plural|+ _e_|store biler|

### **Definite nouns**

Add **den/det/de** + **-e** ending:

- den store bilen (the big car)
    
- det store huset (the big house)
    
- de store bilene (the big cars)
    

---

# **5. Verbs**

This is where Norwegian becomes EASY.

There are **no verb conjugations by person**.

I eat = **jeg spiser**  
You eat = **du spiser**  
He eats = **han spiser**

Same form for everyone.

---

## **5.1 Verb Groups**

### **Group 1 (most common): -er verbs**

- å snakke → snakker → snakket → har snakket  
    (to speak)
    

### **Group 2: -er but different past**

- å lese → leser → leste → har lest  
    (to read)
    

### **Group 3: Short verbs**

- å tro → tror → trodde → har trodd  
    (to believe)
    

### **Irregular verbs**

- å være → er → var → har vært (to be)
    
- å gjøre → gjør → gjorde → har gjort (to do)
    

---

# **6. Tenses**

Norwegian keeps tenses simple. Most meanings come from context.

---

## **6.1 Present (Presens)**

Form: **verb + er** or stem form

- Jeg spiser. (I eat / I am eating)
    

---

## **6.2 Past (Preteritum)**

- Han bodde i Oslo. (He lived in Oslo)
    

---

## **6.3 Present Perfect (Perfekt)**

Form: **har + past participle**

- Jeg har spist. (I have eaten)
    

---

## **6.4 Past Perfect**

Form: **hadde + past participle**

- Han hadde gått. (He had gone)
    

---

## **6.5 Future**

Two ways:

1. **skal + infinitive**
    
    - Jeg skal spise. (I will eat / I’m going to eat)
        
2. **vil + infinitive**
    
    - Jeg vil spise. (I want/will eat)
        

---

# **7. Pronouns**

|English|Norwegian|
|---|---|
|I|jeg|
|you|du|
|he|han|
|she|hun|
|we|vi|
|you (pl.)|dere|
|they|de|

Object pronouns:  
meg, deg, ham/han, henne, oss, dere, dem

# **8. Word Order (Very Important)**

## **8.1 Basic Order: SVO**

Subject – Verb – Object

- Jeg spiser pizza. (I eat pizza)
    

---

## **8.2 V2 Rule (Critical for Norwegian)**

The **verb must be the 2nd element** in the sentence.

If you move something to the front (time/place), the verb jumps to position 2.

- I dag **spiser** jeg pizza.  
    (Today I eat pizza.)
    
- På bordet **ligger** boken.  
    (On the table lies the book.)
    

This V2 rule defines Scandinavian languages.

# **9. Questions**

Two types:

## **9.1 Yes/No Questions**

Verb comes first.

- Spiser du? (Are you eating?)
    

## **9.2 WH-Questions**

WH-word → Verb → Subject

- Hva spiser du? (What are you eating?)
    
- Hvor bor du? (Where do you live?)
    

---

# **10. Negation**

The word is **ikke**.

Placement:  
**Subject – Verb – ikke – rest**

---

# **11. Possessives**
