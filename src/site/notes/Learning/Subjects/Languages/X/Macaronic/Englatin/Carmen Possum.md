The nox was lit by lux of Luna,  
And 'twas a nox most opportuna  
To catch a possum or a coona;  
For nix was scattered o'er this mundus,  
A shallow nix, et non profundus.  
On sic a nox with canis unus,  
Two boys went out to hunt for coonus.  
The corpus of this bonus canis  
Was full as long as octo span is,  
But brevior legs had canis never  
Quam had hic dog; et bonus clever.  
Some used to say, in stultum jocum  
Quod a field was too small locum  
For sic a dog to make a turnus  
Circum self from stem to sternus.  
Unus canis, duo puer,  
Nunquam braver, nunquam truer,  
Quam hoc trio nunquam fuit,  
If there was I never knew it.  
This bonus dog had one bad habit,  
Amabat much to tree a rabbit,  
Amabat plus to chase a rattus,  
Amabat bene tree a cattus.  
But on this nixy moonlight night  
This old canis did just right.  
Nunquam treed a starving rattus,  
Nunquam chased a starving cattus,  
But sucurrit on, intentus  
On the track and on the scentus,  
Till he trees a possum strongum,  
In a hollow trunkum longum.  
Loud he barked in horrid bellum,  
Seemed on terra vehit pellum.
Quickly ran the duo puer  
Mors of possum to secure.  
Quam venerit, one began  
To chop away like quisque man.  
Soon the axe went through the truncum  
Soon he hit it all kerchunkum;  
Combat deepens, on ye braves!
Canis, pueri et staves  
As his powers non longius carry,  
Possum potest non pugnare.  
On the nix his corpus lieth.  
Down to Hades spirit flieth,  
Joyful pueri, canis bonus,  
Think him dead as any stonus.
Now they seek their pater's domo,  
Feeling proud as any homo,  
Knowing, certe, they will blossom  
Into heroes, when with possum  
They arrive, narrabunt story,  
Plenus blood et plenior glory.  
Pompey, David, Samson, Caesar,  
Cyrus, Black Hawk, Shalmanezer!  
Tell me where est now the gloria,  
Where the honors of victoria? 
Nunc a domum narrent story,  
Plenus sanguine, tragic, gory.  
Pater praiseth, likewise mater,  
Wonders greatly younger frater.  
Possum leave they on the mundus,
Go themselves to sleep profundus,  
Somniunt possums slain in battle,  
Strong as ursae, large as cattle.  
When nox gives way to lux of morning,  
Albam terram much adorning,  
Up they jump to see the varmin,  
Of the which this is the carmen.  
Lo! possum est resurrectum!  
Ecce pueri dejectum,  
Ne relinquit back behind him,  
Et the pueri never find him.  
Cruel possum! bestia vilest,  
How the pueros thou beguilest!  
Pueri think non plus of Caesar,  
Go ad Orcum, Shalmanezer,  
Take your laurels, cum the honor,  
Since ista possum is a goner!

# Translation

The night was lit by the light of the Moon,  
And it was a most opportune night  
To catch a possum or a coon;  
For snow was scattered over this world,  
A shallow snow, and not deep.  
On such a night with one dog,  
Two boys went out to hunt for coons.  
The body of this good dog  
Was as long as eight spans,  
But no dog ever had shorter legs  
Than this one; and he was clever.  
Some used to say, in a silly joke,  
That a field was too small a place  
For such a dog to make a turn  
Around himself from stem to stern.  
One dog, two boys,  
Never braver, never truer,  
Than this trio ever was,  
If there was, I never knew it.  
This good dog had one bad habit,  
He loved much to tree a rabbit,  
He loved more to chase a rat,  
He loved well to tree a cat.  
But on this snowy moonlight night  
This old dog did just right.  
Never treed a starving rat,  
Never chased a starving cat,  
But ran on, intent  
On the track and on the scent,  
Until he treed a strong possum,  
In a long hollow trunk.  
Loud he barked in a horrible battle,  
It seemed on earth he carried a skin.  
Quickly ran the two boys  
To secure the death of the possum.  
When they arrived, one began  
To chop away like every man.  
Soon the axe went through the trunk,  
Soon he hit it with a loud crash;  
Combat deepens, on ye brave!  
Dog, boys, and sticks  
As his powers no longer carry,  
Possum can no longer fight.  
On the snow his body lies.  
Down to Hades his spirit flies,  
Joyful boys, good dog,  
Think him dead as any stone.
Now they seek their father's house,  
Feeling proud as any man,  
Knowing, certainly, they will blossom  
Into heroes, when with possum  
They arrive, they will tell the story,  
Full of blood and even fuller of glory.  
Pompey, David, Samson, Caesar,  
Cyrus, Black Hawk, Shalmanezer!  
Tell me where is now the glory,  
Where the honors of victory?  
Now at home they tell the story,  
Full of blood, tragic, gory.  
Father praises, likewise mother,  
Greatly wonders younger brother.  
They leave the possum on the ground,  
They go themselves to deep sleep,  
They dream of possums slain in battle,  
Strong as bears, large as cattle.  
When night gives way to morning light,  
White earth much adorning,  
Up they jump to see the varmint,  
Of which this is the song.  
Lo! possum is resurrected!  
Behold the boys are dejected,  
He did not leave behind him,  
And the boys never find him.  
Cruel possum! vilest beast,  
How you deceive the boys!  
Boys think no more of Caesar,  
Go to Hell, Shalmanezer,  
Take your laurels, with the honor,  
Since this possum is a goner!
