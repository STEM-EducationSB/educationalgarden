## 1. The Big Picture: Latin Has **6 Core Tenses**

Latin verbs are organized by **time + aspect**, not just “past / present / future”.

|Time|Aspect|Latin Tense|
|---|---|---|
|Present|ongoing / general|**Present**|
|Past|ongoing / habitual|**Imperfect**|
|Past|completed|**Perfect**|
|Past|completed before another past|**Pluperfect**|
|Future|simple|**Future**|
|Future|completed before another future|**Future Perfect**|

## 2. Present Tense (Tempus Praesēns)

**Meaning**

- happening now
    
- general truth
    
- habitual action
    

**Example (amāre – to love)**

> amō – I love  
> amās – you love  
> amat – he/she loves

**Uses**

- “I am reading”
    
- “I read every day”
    
- “Water boils at 100°C”
    

Latin does **not** distinguish simple vs continuous. Context does the work.

## 3. Imperfect Tense (Tempus Imperfectum)

**Meaning**

- was doing
    
- used to do
    
- ongoing in the past
    

Think: **unfinished past**.

**Example**

> amābam – I was loving  
> amābās – you were loving

**Signal words**

- always, often, while, used to
    

If the action has **no clear end**, Latin prefers imperfect.

---

## 4. Perfect Tense (Tempus Perfectum)

**Meaning**

- did
    
- have done
    
- completed action
    

**Example**

> amāvī – I loved / I have loved  
> amāvistī – you loved

This is the **default narrative past tense** in Latin texts.

If something **happened and ended**, this is your tense.

---

## 5. Pluperfect Tense (Tempus Plusquamperfectum)

**Meaning**

- had done
    
- completed before another past action
    

**Example**

> amāveram – I had loved  
> amāverās – you had loved

Used when:

- two past actions exist
    
- one happened **earlier**
    

---

## 6. Future Tense (Tempus Futūrum)

**Meaning**

- will do
    

**Example**

> amābō – I will love  
> amābis – you will love

Latin futures are **decisive**, not vague like English “going to”.

---

## 7. Future Perfect Tense (Tempus Futūrum Exāctum)

**Meaning**

- will have done
    
- completed before another future action
    

**Example**

> amāverō – I will have loved

Used when something must be **finished first**.

## 8. Latin Time Logic (Important Insight)

Latin thinks in **completion**, not chronology.

|Question|Tense|
|---|---|
|Is it happening now?|Present|
|Was it ongoing?|Imperfect|
|Was it completed?|Perfect|
|Was it completed before another past?|Pluperfect|
|Will it happen?|Future|
|Will it be completed before another future?|Future Perfect|

This is why Latin feels **mathematical**. Once you lock this logic in, everything clicks.

|I ate / I have eaten|Perfect|
|I had eaten|Pluperfect|
|I will eat|Future|
|I will have eaten|Future Perfect|

## 10. What Comes Next (Straight Talk)

If you stop here, you will **recognize tenses but not command them**.

To truly control Latin tense, the next steps are:

1. **Verb conjugations by conjugation group (1–4)**
    
2. **Perfect system stems**
    
3. **Active vs Passive**
    
4. **Sequence of tenses (crucial for clauses)**
