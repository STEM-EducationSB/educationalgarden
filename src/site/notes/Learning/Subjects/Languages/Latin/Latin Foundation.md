### **1. Learn Pronunciation**

Latin pronunciation differs slightly depending on Classical or Ecclesiastical style. Let’s focus on **Classical Latin** first (used by ancient Romans):

- **Vowels**:
    
    - a = “ah” as in _father_
        
    - e = “ay” as in _they_ (long) / “eh” as in _pet_ (short)
        
    - i = “ee” as in _machine_ (long) / “i” as in _sit_ (short)
        
    - o = “oh” as in _note_ (long) / “o” as in _pot_ (short)
        
    - u = “oo” as in _rude_ (long) / “u” as in _put_ (short)
        
- **Consonants**:
    
    - c = always hard like _cat_
        
    - g = always hard like _go_
        
    - v = pronounced like _w_
        

Example:

- **Veni, vidi, vici** → “Weh-nee, wee-dee, wee-kee”

### **2. Basic Grammar**

Latin is **inflected**, meaning endings change to indicate function in the sentence. Start with **nouns** (declensions) and **verbs** (conjugations).

**Nouns**: 5 declensions, changing endings for case (subject, object, etc.)

- **Example (1st declension, feminine)**
    
    - _puella_ = girl
        
    - _puella_ (subject) → the girl
        
    - _puellam_ (object) → the girl
        
    - _puellae_ (of the girl / to the girl)
        
- **Example (2nd declension, masculine)**
    
    - _servus_ = slave
        
    - _servus_ → subject
        
    - _servum_ → object
        
    - _servi_ → of the slave
        

**Verbs**: Conjugations indicate person, number, tense, mood.

- **Example: “to love” (amare, 1st conjugation)**
    
    - _amo_ → I love
        
    - _amas_ → you love
        
    - _amat_ → he/she/it loves
        
    - _amamus_ → we love
        
    - _amatis_ → you (plural) love
        
    - _amant_ → they love

### **3. Essential Vocabulary**

- **Gratias tibi ago** → Thank you
    
- **Aqua** → Water
    
- **Terra** → Earth
