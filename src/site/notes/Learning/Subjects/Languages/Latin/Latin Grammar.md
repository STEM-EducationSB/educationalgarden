## 1. Core Principle of Latin Grammar

Latin is a **highly inflected language**.

That means:

- **Word endings matter more than word order**
    
- Meaning is carried by **cases, genders, numbers, tenses, moods**
    

English:

> _The girl loves the boy._

Latin can say the same thing in many orders because endings tell you who does what.

---

## 2. Nouns (Substantives)

### 2.1 Gender

Latin has **three grammatical genders**:

- **Masculine**
    
- **Feminine**
    
- **Neuter**
    

Gender is grammatical, not biological.

Examples:

- _puella_ (girl) → feminine
    
- _servus_ (slave) → masculine
    
- _bellum_ (war) → neuter
    

---

### 2.2 Number

- **Singular**
    
- **Plural**
    

---

### 2.3 Cases (THIS IS CRITICAL)

Latin has **6 main cases** (+ vocative):

|Case|Function|English idea|
|---|---|---|
|Nominative|Subject|“who/what”|
|Accusative|Direct object|“whom/what”|
|Genitive|Possession|“of”|
|Dative|Indirect object|“to/for”|
|Ablative|Means / from / by / with|“by/with/from”|
|Vocative|Address|“O!”|

Example:

- _puella_ = the girl (subject)
    
- _puellam_ = the girl (object)
    
- _puellae_ = of/to the girl
    

---

## 3. Declensions (Noun Patterns)

Latin nouns fall into **5 declensions** based on their endings.

### 1st Declension (mostly feminine)

Example: _puella_ (girl)

|Case|Singular|Plural|
|---|---|---|
|Nom|puella|puellae|
|Acc|puellam|puellās|
|Gen|puellae|puellārum|
|Dat|puellae|puellīs|
|Abl|puellā|puellīs|

---

### 2nd Declension (masculine + neuter)

Masculine example: _servus_  
Neuter example: _bellum_

**Neuter Rule (IMPORTANT):**

> Neuter nominative = accusative  
> Neuter plural ends in **-a**

---

## 4. Adjectives

Adjectives **must agree** with the noun in:

- Gender
    
- Number
    
- Case
    

Example:

- _puella bona_ → good girl
    
- _servum bonum_ → good slave
    
- _bella magna_ → great wars
    

Adjective ≠ same declension as noun, only same **form**.

## 5. Pronouns (Basic Set)

| Latin         | English        |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| ego           | I              |
| tū            | you (singular) |
| is / ea / id  | he / she / it  |
| nōs           | we             |
| vōs           | you (plural)   |
| eī / eae / ea | they           |

Latin often **drops subject pronouns** because verb endings already tell you who is acting.

---

## 6. Verbs — The Engine of Latin

### 6.1 Verb Parts

A Latin verb is identified by **four principal parts**:

Example: _amō, amāre, amāvī, amātum_  
(I love, to love, loved, loved)

Each part unlocks different tenses.

---

### 6.2 Conjugations (Verb Families)

There are **4 conjugations**, based on the infinitive ending:

| Conj | Ending | Example |
| ---- | ------ | ------- |
| 1st  | -āre   | amāre   |
| 2nd  | -ēre   | monēre  |
| 3rd  | -ere   | regere  |
| 4th  | -īre   | audīre  |

---

### 6.3 Present Tense (Active)

Example: _amāre_ (to love)

| Person | Latin  | English       |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| 1s     | amō    | I love        |
| 2s     | amās   | you love      |
| 3s     | amat   | he/she loves  |
| 1p     | amāmus | we love       |
| 2p     | amātis | you (pl) love |
| 3p     | amant  | they love     |

---

## 7. Tenses Overview

Latin has **6 tenses** in the indicative:

| Tense          | Meaning                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Present        | amō – I love                |
| Imperfect      | amābam – I was loving       |
| Future         | amābō – I will love         |
| Perfect        | amāvī – I loved             |
| Pluperfect     | amāveram – I had loved      |
| Future Perfect | amāverō – I will have loved |

---

## 8. Voices & Moods

### Voices

- **Active** – subject acts
    
- **Passive** – subject is acted upon
    

### Moods

- **Indicative** – facts
    
- **Imperative** – commands
    
- **Subjunctive** – purpose, doubt, possibility (advanced but central)
    

---

## 9. Word Order (Do Not Think English)

Typical Latin order:

> **Subject – Object – Verb**

Example:

- _Puella librum legit._  
    “The girl reads the book.”
    

But order is flexible for emphasis.

## 10. Prepositions + Cases

| Preposition | Case | Meaning |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- |
| in          | acc  | into    |
| in          | abl  | in      |
| ad          | acc  | to      |
| cum         | abl  | with    |
| ex          | abl  | out of  |

---

## 11. Why Latin Feels Hard (Truth)

- You cannot “translate word-by-word”
    
- You must **read endings first**
    
- Memorization is unavoidable early on
    

But once declensions and conjugations lock in, progress accelerates fast.

## 12. What I Recommend Next

If you want to continue **properly**, the next logical steps are:

1. Full **2nd & 3rd declension mastery**
    
2. All **present system verb tenses**
    
3. Core **subjunctive uses** (purpose, result)
    
4. Reading **real Latin sentences**, not isolated words
