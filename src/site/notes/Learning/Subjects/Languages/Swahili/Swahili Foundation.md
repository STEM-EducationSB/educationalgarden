## 1. What Swahili Is (Straight Facts)

- **Native to**: East Africa
    
- **Countries**: Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, eastern DRC
    
- **Type**: Bantu language with strong Arabic influence
    
- **Writing system**: Latin alphabet
    
- **Pronunciation**: Extremely consistent (what you see is what you say)
    

You already have experience with Arabic and Persian structures—this will help with vocabulary recognition, though grammar is very different.

## 2. Alphabet & Pronunciation

Swahili uses the **English alphabet**, except:

- **No Q**
    
- **No X**
    

### Vowels (Always Pure)

|Letter|Sound|
|---|---|
|A|ah|
|E|eh|
|I|ee|
|O|oh|
|U|oo|

Once you lock this in, pronunciation stops being a problem permanently.

## 3. Core Greetings (Essential First Layer)

|Swahili|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Jambo|Hello (general)|
|Habari?|How are you?|
|Habari gani?|What’s the news?|
|Nzuri|Good / Fine|
|Asante|Thank you|
|Asante sana|Thank you very much|
|Karibu|Welcome|
|Tafadhali|Please|
|Pole|Sorry / Take care|

**Reality check**: “Jambo” is correct, but locals use **Habari?** more naturally.

---

## 4. Personal Pronouns (Simple, Clean)

|Swahili|English|
|---|---|
|Mimi|I|
|Wewe|You (singular)|
|Yeye|He / She|
|Sisi|We|
|Ninyi|You (plural)|
|Wao|They|

Swahili **does not use gender** in pronouns. That alone makes it easier than Arabic.

---

## 5. Verb System (This Is Where Swahili Shines)

Swahili verbs follow a **mathematical structure**.

### Verb Formula

**Subject + Tense + Verb Root**

### Example: _Kula_ (to eat)

|Sentence|Meaning|
|---|---|
|Ninakula|I am eating|
|Unakula|You are eating|
|Anakula|He/She is eating|
|Tunakula|We are eating|
|Mnakula|You (pl.) are eating|
|Wanakula|They are eating|

Once you understand this, Swahili becomes predictable.

## 6. Basic Tenses (Starter Pack)

|Tense|Marker|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Present|-na-|Ninakula|
|Past|-li-|Nilikula (I ate)|
|Future|-ta-|Nitakula (I will eat)|

No irregular verbs chaos. This is a serious advantage.

---

## 7. Common Nouns (High Frequency)

|Swahili|English|
|---|---|
|Mtu|Person|
|Watu|People|
|Mtoto|Child|
|Chakula|Food|
|Maji|Water|
|Nyumba|House|
|Shule|School|
|Safari|Journey|
|Rafiki|Friend|

Yes—**“Safari” is originally Swahili**.

---

## 8. Numbers 1–10

|Swahili|Number|
|---|---|
|Moja|1|
|Mbili|2|
|Tatu|3|
|Nne|4|
|Tano|5|
|Sita|6|
|Saba|7|
|Nane|8|
|Tisa|9|
|Kumi|10|

Logical and phonetic.

---

## 9. Sentence Order

Swahili uses:  
**Subject – Verb – Object**

Same as English.

> Mimi ninakula chakula  
> I am eating food

No surprises here.
