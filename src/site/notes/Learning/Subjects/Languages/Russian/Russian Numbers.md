## **Russian Numbers 1-10**

First, we will look at Russian cardinal numbers 1 to 10. A cardinal number is used for counting how many of something there is. They start from 1 and do not include fractions.

![](https://lingopie.com/blog/content/images/2025/12/Russian-Numbers--2--1.jpg)

****Russian Numbers 1-5****

As you could guess, cardinals are very important aspects of language. You need to be able to use them for ordering food and drink (_two coffees, please_), counting objects (_there is one tree in the garden_) and giving specific information (_I have a table for four_).

Here are the Russian numbers 1 to 10:

- Один (“odin”) - One
- Два (“dva”) - Two
- Три (“tri”) - Three
- Четыре (“chetyre”) - Four
- Пять (“pyat”) - Five
- Шесть (“shest”) - Six
- Семь (“sem”) - Seven
- Восемь (“vosem”) - Eight
- Девять (“deviat”) - Nine
- Десять (“desiat”) - Ten

The words in parenthesis illustrate how these numbers are written in the Latin alphabet.

****Russian Numbers 6-10****

They instruct the correct Russian pronunciation, however, they are not phonetic. "Odin", for instance, is pronounced like "ah deen".

You might benefit from looking up YouTube videos or podcasts of Russian lessons on your computer so you can listen to a native using number-related vocab in Russian.

This will help you to learn the correct pronunciation.

### **How To Use Russian Numbers In A Sentence**

We won't lean too heavily into grammar today, but it is worth noting the following:

When the numbers one and two, or один (“odin”) and два (“dva”), are put before a noun, they change their form according to the gender of the noun. In Russian, nouns can be masculine, feminine or neuter in gender:

- Masculine: один ("odin"); два ("dva")
- Feminine: одна ("odna"); две ("dve")
- Neuter: одно ("odno"); два ("dva")

Here are some examples to illustrate:

1. Masculine nouns:

- Один стол ("odin stol") - One table
- Два стула ("dva stula") - Two chairs

1. Feminine nouns:

- Одна книга ("odna kniga") - One book
- Две кошки ("dve koshki") - Two cats

1. Neuter nouns:

- Одно яблоко ("odno yabloko") - One apple
- Два окна ("dva okna") - Two windows

### **Russian Ordinal Numbers**

Most ordinal numbers are relatively easy to learn once you know how to count in Russian, with the exception of "first" and "second", as they look similar to the cardinal numbers.

Knowing ordinals in Russian is very useful for making lists, establishing rankings and so on. They look like this:

- Первый ("pervyy") - First
- Второй ("vtoroy") - Second
- Третий ("tretiy") - Third
- Четвертый ("chetvyortyy") - Fourth
- Пятый ("pyatyy") - Fifth
- Шестой ("shestoy") - Sixth
- Седьмой ("sedmoy") - Seventh
- Восьмой ("vosmoy") - Eighth
- Девятый ("devyatyy") - Ninth
- Десятый ("desyatyy") - Tenth

### **Russian Numbers: Counting from 11 to 20 in Russian**

To form numbers 11 to 19, we generally add надцать ("nadtsat") to the numbers 1-9. Think of надцать as similar to "-teen" in English. However, as always with foreign languages, there are exceptions to the rules! For number 12, два changes to две. Moreover, when forming the number 14, the "e" at the end of "четырe" is dropped.

Let's break it down with examples:

- 11 - одиннадцать ("odinnadtsat") Example: У меня одиннадцать книг. (U menya odinnadtsat' knig.) - I have eleven books.
- 12 - двенадцать ("dvenadtsat") Note: Here, два changes to две. Example: Мне двенадцать лет. (Mne dvenadtsat' let.) - I am twelve years old.
- 13 - тринадцать ("trinadtsat") Example: В классе тринадцать студентов. (V klasse trinadtsat' studentov.) - There are thirteen students in the class.
- 14 - четырнадцать ("chetyrnadtsat") Note: The "e" at the end of "четырe" is dropped. Example: Я купил четырнадцать яблок. (Ya kupil chetyrnadtsat' yablok.) - I bought fourteen apples.

15 to 19 - The soft sign ь is dropped from the original numbers:

- 15 - пятнадцать ("pyatnadtsat")
- 16 - шестнадцать ("shestnadtsat")
- 17 - семнадцать ("semnadtsat")
- 18 - восемнадцать ("vosemnadtsat")
- 19 - девятнадцать ("devyatnadtsat")

Example: Мне нужно девятнадцать рублей. (Mne nuzhno devyatnadtsat' rubley.) - I need nineteen rubles.

- 20 - двадцать ("dvadtsat") This one is a bit different, but easy to remember! Example: На столе двадцать тарелок. (Na stole dvadtsat' tarelok.) - There are twenty plates on the table.

📖

Practice Tip: __Try counting objects around you using these new numbers. For example, count your books, pens, or even fingers and toes! Say each number out loud as you count. This will help you remember both the numbers and their pronunciation.__

### **How to Count up from 20 in Russian**

![](https://lingopie.com/blog/content/images/2025/12/How-to-Count-up-from-20-in-Russian.jpg)

From here, counting in Russian is super straightforward. You simply add the numbers 1-9 to 20 to make 21, 22, and so on.

For example, двадцать ("dvadtsat"), which is 20, and oдин (“odin”), 1, come together to make двадцать один _("_dvadtsat odin"), 21.

The same applies to the rest of the tens:

- тридцать ("tridstat") - Thirty
- сорок ("sorok") - Forty
- пятьдесят ("pyatdesya") - Fifty
- шестьдесят ("shestdesyat") - Sixty
- семьдесят ("semdesyat") - Seventy
- восемьдесят ("vosemdesyat") - Eighty
- девяносто ("devyanosto") - Ninety

So, for instance, 33 is тридцать три ("tridtsat tri") and 64 is шестьдесят четыре ("shestdesyat chetyre"). Easy, right?

Try creating your own sentences using these numbers. Start with simple ones like "I have..." (У меня есть...) or "I see..." (Я вижу...). For example:

- Я вижу двадцать три птицы. (Ya vizhu dvadtsat' tri ptitsy.) - I see twenty-three birds.
- У меня есть восемьдесят семь карандашей. (U menya est' vosem'desyat sem' karandashey.) - I have eighty-seven pencils.

Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't be afraid to use these numbers in your daily Russian practice. The more you use them, the more natural they'll become. You're doing great - keep it up!

#### **Counting in the Hundreds in Russian**

In Russian, like in English, we build larger numbers by combining hundreds, tens, and ones. The order is always: [Hundreds] + [Tens] + [Ones].

First, memorize these numbers for hundreds:

![](https://lingopie.com/blog/content/images/2025/12/Counting-in-the-Hundreds-in-Russian.jpg)

****Counting in the Hundreds in Russian****

- стo ("sto") - One hundred
- двести ("dvesti") - Two hundred
- триста ("trista") - Three hundred
- четыреста ("chetyresta") - Four hundred
- пятьсот ("pyatsot") - Five hundred
- шестьсот ("shestsot") - Six hundred
- семьсот ("semsot") - Seven hundred
- восемьсот ("vosemsot") - Eight hundred
- девятьсот ("devyatsot") - Nine hundred

Let's build some numbers:

- 245 - двести сорок пять ("dvesti sorok pyat'") = 200 (двести) + 40 (сорок) + 5 (пять)
- 378 - триста семьдесят восемь ("trista sem'desyat vosem'") = 300 (триста) + 70 (семьдесят) + 8 (восемь)
- 501 - пятьсот один ("pyat'sot odin") = 500 (пятьсот) + 0 + 1 (один)

Now, try forming these numbers:

- 632
- 815
- 999

Tips for Beginners:

1. Practice saying the hundreds out loud. Repetition helps with memorization.
2. Start with "round" numbers like 100, 200, 300 before moving to more complex ones.
3. Use real-life contexts: imagine counting money or objects to make it more relatable.
4. Don't worry about perfection. Even if you make mistakes, native speakers will usually understand you.

#### **Counting in the Thousands in Russian**

![](https://lingopie.com/blog/content/images/2025/12/Counting-in-the-Thousands-in-Russian.jpg)

To form other thousands, we use a number + тысяча, but the form of тысяча changes depending on the number before it. To do this, review the basic forms below:

- 1,000 - одна тысяча ("odna tysyacha")
- 2,000 - две тысячи ("dve tysyachi")
- 3,000 - три тысячи ("tri tysyachi")
- 4,000 - четыре тысячи ("chetyre tysyachi")
- 5,000 and above - [number] тысяч ("[number] tysyach")

To form numbers like 1,234 or 5,678, combine what you've learned about hundreds with thousands:

- 1,234 - одна тысяча двести тридцать четыре ("odna tysyacha dvesti tridtsat' chetyre")
- 5,678 - пять тысяч шестьсот семьдесят восемь ("pyat' tysyach shest'sot sem'desyat vosem'")

Remember:

- For 1,000 to 4,000, тысяча changes its ending.
- For 5,000 and above, always use тысяч.
- The number before тысяча follows the gender rules (одна, две for feminine).

Keep practicing, and soon you'll be counting large numbers in Russian with ease! Try creating simple sentences using these numbers to reinforce your learning.

#### **Saying Years Using Numbers in Russian**

The Russian word for "year" is год (pronounced "god"). It's a masculine noun, which is important to remember. In Russian, we express years similarly to English, but with a twist:

- We use ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) instead of cardinal numbers (one, two, three, etc.)
- The year is expressed as a single compound number

Here are some examples:

- 1925: тысяча девятьсот двадцать пятый (tysyacha devyat'sot dvadtsat' pyatyy)
- 1876: тысяча восемьсот семьдесят шестой (tysyacha vosem'sot semdesyat shestoy)

Note: When expressing years, there are two ways to say 1000 in Russian:

- тысяча (tysyacha or tyshcha) - commonly used in spoken language
- одна тысяча (odna tysyacha) - more formal

#### **How to Say the Time in Russian**

When you are saying the time rounded to the neasrest hour, you say the cardinal plus час ("chas"), часа ("chasa") or часов ("chasov"). You say час for 1 o’clock, часа for 2 to 4 o’clock, and часов for 5 through 12 o’clock.

So, два часа ("dva chasa") means it's two o'clock and восемь часов ("vosem chasov") is it's eight o'clock. Simple!

Russians often use these handy expressions:

- Half past = половина (polovina) + next hour in genitive case Example: 1:30 - половина второго (polovina vtorogo)
- Quarter past = четверть (chetvert') + next hour in genitive case Example: 2:15 - четверть третьего (chetvert' tret'ego)
- Quarter to = без четверти (bez chetverti) + upcoming hour Example: 5:45 - без четверти шесть (bez chetverti shest')

## How Does Counting the Number of Objects, People, Animals, etc., Translate in Russian?

In Russian, counting objects, people, animals, and other things follows a logical system, but there are a few important rules and nuances to keep in mind. Here’s a breakdown of how counting works in different contexts:

#### 1. **Basic Numbers for Objects**

When counting **inanimate objects**, Russian uses the same numbers as in other languages, but the **noun's gender** (masculine, feminine, neuter) and the **case** (nominative, accusative, etc.) will influence the form of the number. For example:

- **1 book** = **одна книга** (odna kniga) – "одна" (one) agrees with the feminine noun "книга" (book).
- **2 books** = **две книги** (dve knigi) – The number "два" changes to "две" to agree with the feminine noun.
- **3 books** = **три книги** (tri knigi) – "три" stays the same, but plural forms are used for the noun.

#### 2. **Counting People**

When counting **people**, the number 1, 2, and 3 change depending on the gender of the person. For example:

- **1 man** = **один мужчина** (odin muzhchina) – masculine form.
- **2 men** = **два мужчины** (dva muzhchiny) – the number "два" changes to agree with the masculine noun.
- **3 men** = **три мужчины** (tri muzhchiny).

For feminine nouns:

- **1 woman** = **одна женщина** (odna zhenshchina) – feminine form of "one."
- **2 women** = **две женщины** (dve zhenshchiny).
- **3 women** = **три женщины** (tri zhenshchiny).

#### 3. **Animals and Other Living Beings**

Similar to people, counting **animals** follows the same structure:

- **1 dog** = **одна собака** (odna sobaka) – feminine noun.
- **2 dogs** = **две собаки** (dve sobaki) – changes due to the gender of the noun.
- **3 dogs** = **три собаки** (tri sobaki).

#### 4. **Using "штучки" for Counting Smaller Items**

In Russian, you might also come across the informal term **"штучки"** (shtuchki), meaning “pieces” or “things,” often used when counting smaller or miscellaneous items. For instance:

- **3 apples** = **три яблока** (tri yabloka) or **три яблочки** (tri yablochki) – "яблочка" is a diminutive form.

#### 5. **Plurals and Declensions**

It’s important to note that in Russian, when counting more than two objects, the noun often takes the **plural** form, and the number will influence the case it’s in. For instance:

- **5 chairs** = **пять стульев** (pyat’ stulyev) – The number **пять** (five) triggers the genitive plural form of the noun **стул** (chair).

Understanding these differences in counting objects, animals, and people in Russian will help you navigate everyday conversations and situations with greater ease. Just remember to adjust the number forms according to the noun's gender and case, and soon you'll be counting like a native!
