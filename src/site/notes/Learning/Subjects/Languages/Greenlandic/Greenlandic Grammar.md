# FULL GREENLANDIC (KALAALLISUT) GRAMMAR — ONE-BLOCK REFERENCE
*A compact but complete structural grammar of Standard West Greenlandic*

---

## 1. LANGUAGE TYPE
- **Family**: Eskimo-Aleut → Inuit → Greenlandic
- **Type**: Polysynthetic, agglutinative, suffixing
- **Alignment**: Ergative–absolutive
- **Core idea**: One word ≈ one sentence

---

## 2. PHONOLOGY & ORTHOGRAPHY

### Vowels
| Short | Long |
|------|------|
| a | aa |
| i | ii |
| u | uu |

- *e* and *o* appear through phonological processes
- Long vowels are written double

### Consonants (simplified)
p t k q  
m n ng  
s v l j  
r rr  

- **q** = uvular k (deep throat sound)
- **rr** = uvular fricative
- Consonant gemination is meaningful

---

## 3. MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE

### Word Template
ROOT + (DERIVATIONAL SUFFIXES) + (INFLECTIONAL SUFFIXES)

- Unlimited derivation
- Inflection closes the word
- No prefixes (almost entirely suffixing)

---

## 4. NOUN GRAMMAR

### Number
- Singular
- Plural

### Core Cases
| Case | Function |
|----|----|
| Absolutive | Intransitive subject, transitive object |
| Ergative | Transitive subject |
| Instrumental | Means / secondary object |
| Allative | To / toward |
| Locative | In / at |
| Ablative | From |
| Prolative | Through / by way of |
| Equative | Like / as |

### Example (illu = house)
- illu → house (ABS)
- illup → the house (ERG)
- illumut → to the house
- illumit → from the house
- illumik → with a house

---

## 5. POSSESSION (ON NOUNS)

Possession is marked directly on the noun.

| Person    | Suffix (ABS) |
| --------- | ------------ |
| my        | -ga          |
| your (sg) | -vit         |
| his/her   | -a           |
| our       | -gut         |
| your (pl) | -si          |
| their     | -at          |

Example:
- illu → house  
- illuga → my house  
- illuavit → your house  

Possession precedes case marking.

---

## 6. PRONOUNS (OPTIONAL)

Pronouns exist but verbs already encode person.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| 1st    | uanga    | uagut  |
| 2nd    | illit    | ilissi |
| 3rd    | una      | uku    |

Used mainly for emphasis or oblique cases.

---

## 7. VERB SYSTEM

### Verb Agreement
Verbs encode:
- Subject person & number
- Object person & number (if transitive)
- Mood
- Sometimes aspect

### Core Moods
| Mood | Use |
|----|----|
| Indicative | Statements |
| Interrogative | Questions |
| Imperative | Commands |
| Optative | Wishes |
| Participial | Subordinate clauses |
| Causative | Because / since |

### Example
- atuarpara  
  *read-1SG→3SG*  
  “I read it.”

- sinippoq  
  *sleep-3SG*  
  “He/she sleeps.”

---

## 8. TENSE & ASPECT
- No strict tense system
- Time inferred from:
  - Context
  - Adverbs
  - Aspectual suffixes
- Aspect > tense

---

## 9. DERIVATIONAL POSTBASES

Postbases modify meaning before inflection.

Examples:
- -fik → place
- -ler → begin
- -sinnaa → can / be able
- -tar → habitually
- -naq → passive-like

Example:
- atuartarfik = school  
  *(read + place)*

---

## 10. NEGATION
- Negation is built into the verb
- Uses special negative suffixes before final agreement
- No separate word like “not”

---

## 11. QUESTIONS
- Marked by interrogative mood
- Word order usually unchanged
- Question words:
  - suna? = what
  - kina? = who
  - sumi? = where

---

## 12. WORD ORDER
- Default: **SOV**
- Often omitted nouns due to verb encoding
- Verb-final tendency

---

## 13. SYNTAX

### Intransitive Clause
SUBJECT(ABS) + VERB

### Transitive Clause
AGENT(ERG) + OBJECT(ABS) + VERB

Example:
- angutip nanoq takuvaa  
  “The man sees the bear.”

---

## 14. SENTENCE = WORD PRINCIPLE

A full English sentence can be a single Greenlandic word.

Example structure:
ROOT + cause + ability + negation + mood + subject/object

This is the defining feature of the language.

---

## 15. KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Greenlandic is logic-heavy, not memorization-heavy
- Learn suffix functions, not isolated words
- Master noun cases and verb agreement early
- Fluency comes from morphological parsing, not vocabulary lists
