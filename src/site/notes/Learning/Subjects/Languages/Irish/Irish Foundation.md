## 1. What Irish (Gaeilge) Is

- **Native name:** Gaeilge
    
- **Language family:** Indo-European → Celtic → **Goidelic**
    
- **Closest relatives:** Scottish Gaelic, Manx
    
- **Status:** First official language of Ireland, EU official language
    
- **Script:** Latin alphabet (with special features)
    

Irish is **not English with Celtic words**. Its grammar logic is fundamentally different. Accept that early, and learning becomes easier.

---

## 2. Alphabet & Sounds (Critical Early Step)

### Alphabet

Irish uses **18 letters**:  
A B C D E F G H I L M N O P R S T U

**Missing letters:** J K Q V W X Y Z  
(They appear only in loanwords.)

### Key Sound Features

- **Broad vs Slender consonants**
    
    - Broad: next to **A O U**
        
    - Slender: next to **E I**
        
- This distinction **changes pronunciation and meaning**
    

Example:

- **bó** = cow
    
- **beo** = alive
    

This concept is non-negotiable. Master it early.

---

## 3. The Síneadh Fada (Accent Mark)

The **fada (´)** lengthens vowels:

- a → á
    
- e → é
    
- i → í
    
- o → ó
    
- u → ú
    

Examples:

- **fear** = man
    
- **féar** = grass
    

Miss the fada, you change the word.

---

## 4. Word Order (Major Difference from English)

### Irish Sentence Structure

**Verb – Subject – Object (VSO)**

English:

> I eat bread.

Irish:

> **Ithim arán.**  
> (Literally: _Eat-I bread_)

This stays consistent across tenses.

---

## 5. Pronouns (Basic)

|English|Irish|
|---|---|
|I|mé|
|you (sing.)|tú|
|he|sé|
|she|sí|
|we|muid|
|you (plural)|sibh|
|they|siad|

---

## 6. The Verb “To Be” (Two Systems!)

Irish has **two ways to say “to be”**. This confuses beginners, so understand the logic.

### 1️⃣ **Tá** – temporary states / location

- Tá mé anseo. → I am here.
    
- Tá sé fuar. → It is cold.
    

### 2️⃣ **Is** – identity / definition

- Is mac léinn mé. → I am a student.
    
- Is Éireannach é. → He is Irish.
    

If you mix these, natives will notice immediately.

---

## 7. Initial Mutations (Very Important)

Irish changes the **first letter of words** depending on grammar.

### Lenition (Séimhiú)

Adds **h** after consonants:

- b → bh
    
- c → ch
    
- m → mh
    

Example:

- **bean** (woman)
    
- **mo bhean** (my woman / wife)
    

This is grammatical, not optional.

---

## 8. Definite Article “The”

Irish has **one word for “the”**:

- **an**
    

But it **causes mutations**:

- an fear (the man)
    
- an bhean (the woman)
    

---

## 9. Numbers (1–10)

1. a haon
    
2. a dó
    
3. a trí
    
4. a ceathair
    
5. a cúig
    
6. a sé
    
7. a seacht
    
8. a hocht
    
9. a naoi
    
10. a deich
    

Irish counting has **older base-20 logic**, but you can learn modern counting first.

---

## 10. Dialects (Know This Early)

Irish has **three major dialects**:

- **Ulster (Donegal)** – closest to Scottish Gaelic
    
- **Connacht** – often used in media
    
- **Munster** – very traditional pronunciation
    

Pick **one dialect** for pronunciation. Mixing them slows progress.

---

## 11. Is Irish Hard?

**For English speakers:**

- Grammar: Medium-Hard
    
- Pronunciation: Hard at first
    
- Vocabulary: Manageable
    
- Logic: Different, but consistent
    

If you’ve handled **German or Slavic grammar**, Irish is absolutely learnable.

## 12. Smart Learning Path (Recommended)

1. Sounds + broad/slender rule
    
2. Tá vs Is
    
3. Basic verbs in present tense
    
4. Mutations
    
5. Simple conversation
    
6. Reading short sentences daily
    

No shortcuts. Irish rewards discipline.
