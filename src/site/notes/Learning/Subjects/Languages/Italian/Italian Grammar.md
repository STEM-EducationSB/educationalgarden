# Chapter 1 — Introduction: Scope, CEFR mapping, study tips

**Aim:** Explain how the course maps grammar points to CEFR levels (A1–C2). Offer study strategy: spaced repetition for paradigms, active production, comprehension input, and deliberate error correction.

**CEFR highlights (grammar focus):**

- **A1:** basic phrases, present tense, simple articles, pronouns, question words, basic prepositions.
    
- **A2:** past tense introduction (passato prossimo), imperfect basics, simple future, comparatives, modal verbs in present, clitic pronouns basic use.
    
- **B1:** broader past (imperfetto vs passato prossimo), conditional presente, congiuntivo presente introduction in subordinate clauses, complex pronominal structures, relative clauses.
    
- **B2:** subjunctive across tenses, passive forms, advanced clitic combinations, acquisiton of nuanced connectors and idiomatic prepositions.
    
- **C1–C2:** full mastery of sequence of tenses, stylistic alternatives (passato remoto vs passato prossimo), register control, complex topicalization, rhetorical devices, and near-native pragmatic competence.
    

**Study tips:**

- Prioritize production early (speak/write).
    
- Drill high-frequency irregular verbs (essere, avere, andare, fare, dire, stare, vedere, dare)
    
- Use authentic input graded to your level; upgrade gradually.
    

---

# Chapter 2 — Spoken vs. Written Italian; Registers and Style

**Key points:**

- Distinguish colloquial features (ellipses, clitic omission in informal speech, use of "ciao", regional forms) from literary features (passato remoto, more complex subordinate structures).
    
- Register markers include modal verbs, use of congiuntivo, degree of lexical formality, and choice of connectors.
    

**Practice:** Compare two short texts (one spoken transcript, one newspaper paragraph) and list grammar differences.

---

# Chapter 3 — Alphabet, Orthography & Pronunciation

**Alphabet:** 21 letters (A–Z minus j, k, w, x, y as native letters). Cover orthographic rules for C/G before e/i (soft) and before a/o/u (hard), digraphs: ch, gh, gn, gl(i) (pronounced /ʎ/ as in figli), sc (before e/i = /ʃ/), sc before a/o/u = /sk/.

**Stress rules:** usually penultimate; many exceptions; marking with accent on final vowels when necessary (città, perché).

**Double consonants:** phonemic in Italian (pala vs palla). Teach minimal pairs.

**Phonology notes:** vowels (5), allophones, consonant gemination, vowel reduction in unstressed syllables (minor), liaison-like effects in fast speech.

---

# Chapter 4 — Syllable Structure, Stress, Weak Forms

Explain syllabification, rules for stress placement, enclitic stress shift with clitics, and reduced forms (e.g., un’ vs una before vowels). Provide phonetic examples.

---

# Chapter 5 — Punctuation and Capitalization Rules

Discuss Italian conventions: punctuation spacing, use of the em dash, quotation marks (« » and “ ”), capitalization rules (less capitalization than English — months, languages not capitalized), abbreviations.

---

# Chapter 6 — Morphology: Word Classes Overview

Short taxonomy: nouns, adjectives, determiners, numerals, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, particles. Explain inflectional vs derivational morphology with examples.

---

# Chapter 7 — Nouns: Gender, Number, Formation, Irregular Plurals

**Gender rules & tendencies:**

- Typical endings: -o (masc), -a (fem), -e (either)
    
- Greek/Latin origins, living vs non-living, profession names, compound nouns, invariable nouns.
    

**Plural formation:**

- -o → -i; -a → -e; -e → -i
    
- Exceptions: consonant-final foreign words, abbreviated forms, nouns with identical singular/plural.
    

**Special cases:**

- Names of letters, colors used as nouns, mass nouns.
    

**Practice:** transform lists between singular & plural; predict gender using etymology rules.

---

# Chapter 8 — Articles: Definite, Indefinite, Partitive, Zero Article, Contractions

**Definite articles:** il/lo/l’/la/le/i/gli — distribution rules (lo before s+consonant, z, gn, ps, x; l’ before vowels). Explain plural alternations i/gli.

**Indefinite articles:** un/uno/una/un’ and their distribution.

**Partitive:** del/dello/della/dell’/dei/degli/delle — formation and nuance (some/any, part of a mass). Distinguish from zero article in generic statements.

**Zero article:** generalizations with plural nouns, uncountable nouns after parlare di, usare, etc.

**Contractions:** preposition + article (a + il = al; di + la = della; in + lo = nello) — extensive table in appendix.

---

# Chapter 9 — Adjectives: Agreement, Position, Attributive vs Predicative, Comparison

**Agreement:** adjectives agree in gender/number with noun. Provide full paradigms for endings -o/-a/-e/-i and invariant adjectives.

**Position:** default post-nominal; prenominal when emphasizing subjectivity, quantity, inherent property (e.g., _bravo ragazzo_ vs _un ragazzo buono_). Adjectives that significantly change meaning when moved (grande vs piccolo, vecchio vs nuovo; examples: _grande uomo_ vs _uomo grande_).

**Comparison:** comparatives (più.. di/che, meno.. di/che), equality (tanto.. quanto), absolute superlative (-issimo), relative superlative (il più ... di).

**Practice:** rewrite sentences moving adjectives and note semantic shifts.

---

# Chapter 10 — Determiners: Demonstratives, Possessives, Quantifiers, Interrogatives

**Demonstratives:** questo/quello usage, forms (questo/questa/questi/queste; quell-, quello, quel, quella), distal vs proximal.

**Possessives:** mio/tuo/suo/nostro/vostro/loro — with and without article (article required with family nouns in singular: la mia madre, but il mio padre — regional variance). Agreement rules.

**Quantifiers:** molto, poco, qualche, alcuni, parecchio, parecchi/parecchie; formation and placement.

**Interrogative determiners:** quale, quanto — forms and agreement.

---

# Chapter 11 — Numerals

**Cardinal & ordinal paradigms**, rules for composing numbers, elision (venti + otto → ventotto), agreement with nouns, partitive numerals (un paio di), approximate numerals (una ventina di). Ordinals used with dates and ranking.

---

# Chapter 12 — Pronouns: Personal (Strong, Clitic), Tonic, Direct & Indirect, Reflexive, Reciprocal, Emphatic, Relative, Interrogative, Indefinites

**Personal pronouns:** io, tu, lui/lei/Lei, noi, voi, loro — tonic forms and subject omission.

**Direct object clitics:** mi, ti, lo/la, ci, vi, li/le — placement rules (before finite verbs, attached to infinitive/imperative affirmative, with gerund in some registers).

**Indirect object clitics:** mi, ti, gli/le/le, ci, vi, loro (loro as full form after preposition—avoid clitic mismatch).

**Double object combinations:** me lo, te la, glielo — ordering rules and vowel elision (melo → me lo; glielo → not _gli lo_). Provide full table and formation rules.

**Reflexives:** mi, ti, si, ci, vi, si — difference between true reflexives and pseudo-reflexives (si chiamare) and passive-reflexive.

**Reciprocal verbs:** ci vediamo, si amano — typical constructions.

**Relative pronouns:** che, cui, il quale/quella — uses, prepositional combinations (a cui, di cui), restriction vs non-restrictive, and comma usage.

**Interrogative pronouns:** chi, che/cosa, quale — forms and usage.

**Indefinite pronouns & determiners:** qualcuno, qualcosa, niente/nulla, ognuno, ciascuno, tutto, tutti, entrambi — distribution and quantificational differences.

**Practice:** convert sentences replacing noun phrases with appropriate pronouns; exercise for clitic order combinations.

---

# Chapter 13 — Pronominal Clitics: Order, Placement, Combined Forms, Imperative & Infinitive Cases

**Clitic order template (canonical):** [ne] — [mi/ti/ci/vi] — [glie-] — [lo/la/li/le] often schematized as: (1) reflexive/IO (mi/ti/ci/vi), (2) direct object (lo/la/li/le), (3) ne; but combinations produce contracted forms: me lo → me lo, glielo, etc.

**Placement rules:** before finite verbs (non lo vedo), attached to infinitive (venderlo), attached to gerund in some colloquial varieties but standard places before (lo stavo vedendo), attached to affirmative imperative (dammelo), placed after negative imperative (non me lo dare).

**Special cases:** combined clitics with modal verbs, future periphrasis, and verbs with particle _ci/vi_.

---

# Chapter 14 — Verbs — Overview: Conjugation Classes, Regular vs Irregular, Model Verbs

Explain three conjugation classes (-are, -ere, -ire), distinction between regular and irregular stems, verbs with isc in -ire, orthographic changes (c/g before e/i), and modal/auxiliary verbs as high-frequency irregulars.

Include a large appendix with conjugation tables for the 100 most frequent verbs.

---

# Chapter 15 — Present Indicative: Formation, Uses, Progressive Nuances

**Formation:** full paradigms for -are, -ere, -ire, -ire (isc) verbs with examples.

**Uses:** simple present, habitual actions, present progressive (sto parlando — formed with stare + gerundio), immediate future (andare a + infinitive), historic present.

**Practice:** produce 20 sentences describing daily routine.

---

# Chapter 16 — Imperfect (Imperfetto): Formation, Progressive/Habitual Past, Contrast with Passato Prossimo

**Formation:** stem + vo/vi/va/vamo/vate/vano for all conjugations; uses: background description, habitual past, polite requests, indirect speech in past.

**Contrast exercise:** pairs of sentences (imperfetto vs passato prossimo) explaining aspect differences.

---

# Chapter 17 — Passato Prossimo: Formation with Avere/Essere, Past Participle Agreement, Uses

**Formation:** auxiliary (avere/essere) + past participle. Rules choosing auxiliary (movement, reflexives, unaccusative-like verbs use essere). Agreement: with essere the past participle must agree in gender/number with subject; with avere, agreement occurs only when direct object precedes the verb (clitic + participle: la ho vista/la ho vista — actually "l'ho vista").

**Usage:** completed actions, present relevance, narration of events in spoken Italian.

---

# Chapter 18 — Trapassato Prossimo: Formation and Uses

Formation: imperfetto of auxiliary + past participle. Use to indicate an action anterior to another past reference point. Provide examples and practice converting two-clause sequences to trapassato.

---

# Chapter 22 — Conditional (Presente & Passato): Formation, Polite Requests, Counterfactuals

Presente condizionale: infinitive + ei/esti/ebbe/emmo/este/ebbero (irregular stems mirror futuro). Uses: politeness, hypothetical present/future. Passato condizionale: conditional of auxiliary + past participle for counterfactual in the past or hypothetical past.

**Practice:** write polite requests and counterfactual sentences.

---

# Chapter 23 — Subjunctive (Congiuntivo): Presente, Imperfetto, Passato, Trapassato — Triggers and Sequence of Tenses

**Triggers:** volere/ desiderare, emotion, doubt, impersonal expressions (È importante che…), verbs of opinion in subordinate clauses requiring subjunctive.

**Sequence of tenses:** if main verb is present → subjunctive presente or passato (if anterior), if main verb is past → subjunctive imperfetto or trapassato.

**Forms & irregulars:** provide paradigms and list of frequent irregulars (essere, avere, andare, fare, dare, stare, dire).

**Common errors:** omission where English uses "to"; overuse by learners; incorrect sequence of tenses.

---

# Chapter 24 — Imperative: Affirmative and Negative, Clitics and Formal/Informal Forms

**Forms:** tu (present indicative stem for -are switch to -a; for -ere/-ire use -i), noi, voi, Lei forms (subjunctive present for formal commands). Negative imperative: non + infinitive for tu (non parlare), while noi/voi/Lei use non + present subjunctive in formal registers.

Two passive strategies:

1. Use of essere + past participle (agreement required).
    
2. si passivante: si vende bene il libro = the book sells well / is sold well.
    

Explain semantic differences and agency marking; impersonal si for unspecified agents.

---

# Chapter 28 — Modal Verbs: Potere, Volere, Dovere, Sapere — Periphrastic Constructions

Explain usage: ability, permission, obligation, probability; negation scope with modals; use with infinitive and clitics (non posso farlo / non lo posso fare / non posso farlo with pronoun attached to infinitive). Cover "sapere" + infinitive meaning "to know how to".

---

# Chapter 29 — Causative Constructions: Far + Infinitive, Lasciare + Infinitive

Explain: far + infinitive (faccio riparare la macchina = I have the car repaired / I make someone repair the car). Distinguish agentivity and causation.
