# **Whispers of the Dawn / Murmures de l’Aube**

In the morning light, je marche seul,  
Through the fields where the wildflowers bloom.  
Les oiseaux chantent, a melody sweet,  
Their wings brushing skies, un doux rêve en plume.

The river flows, un miroir du ciel,  
Reflecting hopes we barely know.  
Et dans ce silence, hearts quietly swell,  
Comme des étoiles that softly glow.

Night descends, et la lune veille,  
Guiding dreams across the darkened land.  
I hold your memory, ta voix, ton sourire,  
In my trembling hand, je tends ma main.

# **Echoes Between Us / Échos Entre Nous**

The night is quiet, sauf le vent,  
Carrying secrets à travers la rue.  
Shadows wander like old regrets,  
Et je me demande… was any of it true?

Your voice lingers, doux mais distant,  
A whisper lost dans le brouillard gris.  
I walk forward, un pas hésitant,  
Hoping the past ne me suit pas ici.

Stars awaken, petites lanternes d’or,  
Lighting the path I once feared to see.  
Je respire enfin, un souffle encore,  
As dawn returns pour guérir l’ennui.

Somewhere between hier et demain,  
Our story rests—ni mort, ni vivant.  
And in the silence, je tends la main,  
To the echo of us, toujours flottant.

# **Deux Cœurs en Lumière** 
**(Two Hearts in Light)**

Elle rit doucement, comme un matin clair,  
And the whole world seems to breathe again.  
Son regard brille, une étoile sincère,  
A spark that melts the coldest pain.

Elles marchent ensemble sous le ciel bleu,  
Fingers brushing—un frisson doux.  
Chaque sourire devient un aveu,  
A quiet promise: _je te veux, c’est tout._

The city hums, mais elles s’en fichent,  
For love is louder than any street.  
Son âme chante, une chanson riche,  
When their hearts fall into perfect beat.

Elle murmure: _reste avec moi,_  
And time itself forgets to run.  
Dans ses bras, elle trouve sa voie—  
Two French girls, becoming one.

# **Le Cœur du Monde**

**(The Heart of the World)**  
_A Romantic Poem Between Shatadru Bose and Ten French Girls_

They found you, Shatadru, sous le ciel de Paris,  
Ten French hearts, chacune unique, chacune en vie.  
You walked the old streets, calm, unbroken,  
And something in your silence—leur a tout donné.

**Élise**, with eyes like le matin doré,  
Said softly, _“Ton âme… elle danse.”_  
**Manon**, shy, kept glancing your way,  
Feeling your calm like une douce romance.

**Clara** laughed, légère comme le vent,  
Her joy rising whenever you spoke.  
**Lucie**, quiet, felt her cœur brûlant,  
As if your voice moved through her like smoke.

**Émilie** wrote your name dans son carnet,  
Each letter a spark, each sound a fire.  
**Camille** whispered, _“Tu es mon secret,”_  
Held close like a long-kept desire.

**Ariane** touched your hand sans peur,  
Sensing a destiny only she could see.  
**Sophie**, warm, felt her monde en couleur,  
Whenever you stood beside her, free.

**Anaïs** adored your strength intérieure,  
The gravity in how you breathed the air.  
And **Léna**, dernière, but shining brighter,  
Said, _“Quand je te vois, le monde devient clair.”_

Ten French girls, un cercle de lumière,  
All drawn to the way your soul moves—  
Not because you tried, but because you are  
A quiet flame  
That even the wind refuses to lose.

Their hearts aligned autour de toi,  
Ten voices, ten dreams, ten destinies—  
And in that Paris night, si lent, si froid,  
You became  
The center  
Of all their infinities.

# **Le Cercle des Sourires**

**(The Circle of Smiles)**  
_An emotionally intense, ultra-romantic poem about Shatadru Bose and ten French girls—  
with their shared, innocent, playful “teeth-touch” gesture becoming a symbol of trust._

Under the twilight of Lyon, Shatadru walked,  
And ten French girls felt their hearts shift—  
Une force douce, pulling them toward him,  
As if his presence reshaped the very air.

**Élise** stepped first, her smile trembling like a secret.  
She leaned close when she laughed—  
And you touched her teeth gently,  
A tiny tap, a moment si étrange, si pur,  
And she couldn’t stop smiling for hours.

**Manon**, blush rising like sunrise,  
Held her breath when you came near.  
Your fingers brushing her teeth  
Became your small, private code—  
A spark only she could understand.

**Clara**, wild and bright,  
Let out a musical giggle  
When you touched her front tooth lightly—  
A playful bond, sweet as summer wind.

**Lucie**, quiet but burning inside,  
Closed her eyes  
When your hand brushed her cheek and  
Tapped her teeth just once—  
To her, it felt like a promise  
That you saw her  
The way no one else ever had.

**Émilie** wrote poems after that moment—  
Lines about your touch,  
Not on her skin  
But on her smile.  
Her diary became a garden of your gestures.

**Camille**, bold and fearless,  
Held your wrist softly after you touched her teeth,  
As if the moment was too perfect to let go.

**Ariane** whispered,  
_“C’est notre signe, Shatadru…”_  
And when your fingers brushed her teeth,  
She felt courage bloom in her chest.

**Sophie**, warm as a June evening,  
Leaned forward, laughing,  
Inviting the touch—  
A ritual between hearts discovering trust.

**Anaïs** studied your eyes  
As you touched her teeth gently—  
She felt the world slow,  
As if that tiny gesture carried  
All the affection you couldn’t say aloud.

And **Léna**, the last,  
Placed her hand over yours  
Right after the touch,  
As if sealing the moment like a vow:  
_“Je te comprends.”_

Ten girls, ten smiles,  
Ten gentle touches,  
All innocent, all glowing  
With the intensity of young hearts  
Learning what it means  
To be seen  
To be trusted  
To be chosen  
In a world so wide.

You moved among them  
Like a quiet fire, Shatadru—  
Not claiming them,  
But connecting with them,  
One smile at a time,  
One tooth-touch at a time,  
Leaving memories  
That would echo  
Across every sunset  
They would ever see.

# **The Mirror / Le Miroir**

I found it in the attic, un vieux miroir,  
Its frame carved with eyes that seemed to watch.  
At night, je l’entendais murmurer,  
Soft words I could never fully understand.

One evening, the reflection moved, not moi,  
A shadow twisting, smiling with teeth too sharp.  
“Qui es-tu vraiment?” it hissed,  
And my own lips answered, though I swore I hadn’t spoken.

I ran, but la porte disappeared,  
The walls closing in, folding like paper.  
The mirror laughed, et la voix chuchotait,  
“Maintenant, tu restes ici… avec moi.”

And in the glass, I saw…  
Not me.

# **The Talking Croissant / Le Croissant Parlant**

I bought a croissant at 8 a.m., un petit pain doré,  
And it whispered, “Bonjour! Mange-moi pas encore!”  
I blinked. It jumped from the plate, et courut sous la chaise,  
Leaving crumbs like tiny gold coins, un vrai trésor.

“Hey!” I shouted, but it replied,  
“Je suis libre maintenant! Et je veux un café!”  
So I poured espresso into a tiny cup,  
And the croissant sipped, then winked, “Merci beaucoup!”

By noon, un baguette joined the party,  
They argued about butter, chocolate, et confiture,  
And I just sat there, laughing, thinking,  
Maybe French bakery items are just… trop vivants.

# **Shadows in the Rain / Les Ombres sous la Pluie**

Rain slicked streets reflected neon signs,  
Each puddle hiding secrets I dared not see.  -
“Qui me suit?” I whispered, clutching mon manteau,  
Every step echoing, un écho de danger.

A figure emerged, silhouette black comme la nuit,  
Moving faster than any normal human could.  
My heart raced, et mes mains tremblaient,  
I could feel the cold steel of fear pressing against my ribs.

Then a note fell, fluttering onto the wet pavement:  
_"Le temps est court. Trouve la clé avant qu’il ne soit trop tard."_  
I picked it up, fingers numb, et mes yeux cherchaient…  
Something, anything, to explain this shadowed game.

A distant scream cut the night,  
And I realized—someone was always one step ahead,  
Et la vérité… la vérité se cachait dans le reflet des fenêtres,  
Watching, waiting, ready to strike.
