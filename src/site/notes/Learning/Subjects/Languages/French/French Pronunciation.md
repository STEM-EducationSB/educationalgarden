# 1. Overview & approach

French pronunciation is rule-based and, with targeted practice, highly learnable.

Strategy: learn sound shapes (IPA), train articulatory settings (tongue, lips, jaw), listen actively, and practise aloud with immediate feedback (recording + compare). Prioritise these areas first: pure vowels (including rounded vs unrounded), nasal vowels, the French "r" (uvular ʁ), and liaison/enchaînement.

How to use this document: read each section, repeat example words aloud, do the drills, record yourself, then check the "Answer key" and sample recordings (if you use an external resource).

# 2. French alphabet and accents

Letters: same 26 Latin letters as English. Accents change pronunciation or orthography:

- **é (accent aigu)** — indicates /e/ (closed e). Example: _été_ /ete/.
    
- **è, ê (accent grave / circonflexe)** — usually /ɛ/ (open e). Example: _père_ /pɛʁ/, _fête_ /fɛt/.
    
- **ç (c cédille)** — makes /s/ before a, o, u. Example: _garçon_ /gaʁsɔ̃/.
    
- **î, â, ô** — circonflexe often marks historical spelling change; pronunciation may or may not differ.
    
- **ë, ï, ü** — diaeresis indicates vowel separation (no glide). Example _naïf_ /na.if/.
    

Accents are crucial. Do not ignore them.

# 3. IPA for French — quick chart

**Vowels (oral):** /i/ /e/ /ɛ/ /a/ /ɔ/ /o/ /u/ /y/ /ø/ /œ/ /ə/

**Nasal vowels:** /ɑ̃/ /ɔ̃/ /ɛ̃/ /œ̃/ (often written /ã/ /õ/ /ɛ̃/ /œ̃/)

**Semi-vowels (glides):** /j/ /ɥ/ /w/

**Consonants (examples):** /p b t d k g f v s z ʃ ʒ m n ɲ l ʁ/

Note: French has fewer monophthongs than English and uses glides to produce combinations.

---

# 4. Vowels (oral): detailed guide + examples

**Key principle:** French vowels are steady (monophthongs) and short decisions about openness/rounding matter.

### High front unrounded: /i/

- Sound: like English _see_ but tenser and shorter.
    
- Examples: _si_, _vie_, _fille_ (note: _fille_ has /ij/ historically; modern is /fij/ or /fij/ with glide depending on speaker). Write: /si/, /vi/.
    

### Mid front close: /e/ (é)

- Sound: closed "ay" as in _café_ /kafe/ (no diphthong). Compare with English _say_ which often becomes a diphthong — in French keep it pure.
    
- Examples: _été_ /ete/, _verre_? (careful: _verre_ is /vɛʁ/ not /veʁ/).
    

### Mid front open: /ɛ/ (è, ê)

- Sound: like English _bed_ but a bit more open.
    
- Examples: _mère_ /mɛʁ/, _belle_ /bɛl/.
    

### Low front: /a/

- Sound: open _a_ as in _father_ but fronted.
    
- Examples: _patte_ /pat/, _gars_ /gaʁ/ (note: _garçon_ /gaʁsɔ̃/).
    

### Mid back open: /ɔ/

- Example: _port_, _corps_ (in many environments), _orange_ (/ɔʁɑ̃ʒ/ depending on variety).
    

### Mid back close: /o/ (o)

- Example: _eau_ /o/, _votre_ /votʁ/.
    

### High back rounded: /u/

- Like English _food_ but tighter and pure. _tout_ /tu/.
    

### High front rounded: /y/

- No common direct equivalent in English — like /i/ but with rounded lips. Example: _tu_ vs _ty_? Actually _tu_ is /ty/ in many contexts? Correction: _tu_ is /ty/ meaning the vowel /y/. Example words: _tu_ /ty/, _lune_ /lyn/.
    

### Mid front rounded: /ø/ and /œ/

- /ø/ (close-mid front rounded): _peu_ /pø/.
    
- /œ/ (open-mid front rounded): _leur_ /lœʁ/ (in closed syllable) or _sœur_ /sœʁ/.
    

### Schwa: /ə/ ("e muet")

- Unstressed, variable; often omitted in casual speech. Occurs in _le_ /lə/, _petite_ /pətit/ — but native speakers often drop it: _petite_ → /ptit/ in fast speech. Learn where it can be dropped.
    

**Practice tip:** place a mirror in front of you and note lip rounding vs spreading and jaw openness.

# 5. Nasal vowels

Nasal vowels are a hallmark of French. Nasalisation occurs when a vowel is followed by n or m (and not followed by a vowel). The sound resonates through the nose — do not pronounce a separate /n/ or /m/.

Four primary nasal vowels (common standard):

- /ɑ̃/ spelled often as _an, am, en, em_ — example: _sans_ /sɑ̃/.
    
- /ɔ̃/ spelled _on, om_ — example: _son_ /sɔ̃/.
    
- /ɛ̃/ spelled _in, im, ain, aim, ein_ — example: _vin_ /vɛ̃/.
    
- /œ̃/ spelled _un, um_ — example: _un_ /œ̃/.
    

**Common learner errors:** accidentally adding an oral vowel + consonant (e.g., pronouncing _vin_ as /vin/). To fix: relax the tongue and let air pass through the nose while keeping the mouth vowel shape.

**Practice drill (repeat slowly):** _vin /vɛ̃/ — vent /vɑ̃/ — vin — vent_ (contrast nasal quality).

---

# 6. Semi-vowels (glides)

French uses glides that sound like short versions of vowels preceding another vowel. They are:

- /j/ (y as in _fille_ if pronounced with glide) — similar to English _y_ in _yes_.
    
- /ɥ/ (rounded front glide) — rare in English; appears in _huit_ /ɥit/ and _nuit_ /nɥi/.
    
- /w/ (as in _oui_ /wi/).
    

**Rule of thumb:** do not allow strong diphthongisation. Keep glides short and connect two syllable vowels smoothly.

---

# 7. Consonants: key points

- **/ʁ/** — the French "r": uvular fricative or approximant. Produced at the back of the throat (uvula). Practice gargle-like vibration (but minimal). Common in Parisian French. Alternatives (alveolar r) exist in regional accents.
    
- **/ʃ/ and /ʒ/** — like English _sh_ and _zh_ (measure). Example: _chat_ /ʃa/, _joli_ /ʒoli/.
    
- **/ɲ/** — palatal nasal, spelled _gn_, like Spanish ñ. Example: _compagnon_ /kɔ̃paɲɔ̃/.
    
- **/l/** — clear [l] (not dark L) in many positions.
    
- **Voicing contrasts:** p/b, t/d, k/g, f/v, s/z exist. Word-final consonants are often devoiced or silent (e.g., _grand_ final d often silent or lightly pronounced depending on liaison).
    

**Important:** Many final consonants are silent: _petit_ /pəti/ (final _t_ often pronounced only if liaison), _vous_ /vu/ (final _s_ silent unless liaison).

---

# 8. Liaison, enchaînement, and linking

**Enchaînement:** when a consonant belongs to the next syllable when followed by a vowel: _il arrive_ → /i.l‿a.ʁiv/ (pronounced smoothly).

**Liaison:** pronouncing a normally silent final consonant because the next word begins with a vowel: _vous avez_ /vu.z‿ave/ (the _s_ pronounced as /z/ linking the words). Liaison rules are rule-governed:

- **Mandatory liaisons:** after determiners (les amis), after subject pronouns in inversion (nous avons → nous.zavons?).
    
- **Forbidden liaisons:** after singular nouns and before _et_.
    
- **Optional liaisons:** after verbs preceding subject pronouns (depending on register).
    

**Practice:** Common pairs: _les amis_ /le.z‿ami/, _vous avez_ /vu.z‿ave/, _tout entier_ /tu.t‿ɑ̃tje/.

---

# 9. Elision and the apostrophe

When a vowel-final function word meets a vowel-beginning word, French often drops the vowel and replaces it with an apostrophe: _le ami_ → _l'ami_ /la.mi/.

Common elisions: _le → l'_, _la → l'_, _de → d'_, _je → j'_, _ne → n'_ (in negative constructions).

**Practice:** _Je aime_ → _J'aime_ /ʒɛm/.

---

# 10. Syllable stress, rhythm, and timing

French stress is predictable: generally on the last pronounced syllable of a rhythmic group (not lexical like English). There is no strong lexical stress like in English.

Rhythm: French is syllable-timed — each syllable receives roughly equal time — unlike English (stress-timed). Practise reading slow, dividing words into syllables and keeping steady timing.

---

# 11. Intonation patterns

- **Statements:** falling or level at the end. Example: _Je vais à Paris._ (falling)
    
- **Yes/no questions (informal):** rising pitch toward the end.
    
- **Information questions (who/what/where):** often falling.
    
- **Lists:** rising on each item except final, which falls.
    

**Practice:** record a statement and a yes/no question using the same words — hear the difference.

---

# 12. Common trouble sounds (and how to fix them)

1. **/y/ vs /u/**: English speakers often confuse /y/ with /u/ or /ju/. Fix: pronounce /i/ with rounded lips.
    
2. **Nasal vowels**: either omit nasal quality or add an /n/. Fix: practice humming while shaping the oral vowel.
    
3. **/ʁ/**: many learners use an alveolar r. To train the uvular r — practice gargle-like vibration and weak voiced fricative at the back of the throat.
    
4. **Schwa /ə/**: avoid over-pronouncing; learn where it drops.
    
5. **Liaison errors**: practice set phrase liaisons.
    

---

# 13. Minimal pairs and targeted drills

Create pairs that differ by a single feature. Repeat and record.

**Vowel pairs:** /e/ vs /ɛ/: _bé_ (not a word) vs _bè_ → use _été_ /ete/ vs _être_ /ɛtʁ/.

**Nasal pairs:** _vin_ /vɛ̃/ vs _vent_ /vɑ̃/.

**Rounded vs unrounded:** _tu_ /ty/ vs _tout_ /tu/ vs _ti_ /ti/.

**Practice method:** say pairs slowly, then at speech speed, then embed each into short phrases.

---

# 14. Practice sentences and progressive drills

**Beginner (focus: vowels & simple consonants)**

1. _Je suis étudiant._ — /ʒə sɥi ez.ty.djɑ̃/ (work on /y/ and /ɥ/)
    
2. _Elle a un chat._ — /ɛl a œ̃ ʃa/ (nasal + consonant)
    

**Intermediate (liaison + glides)**

1. _Vous avez un ami._ — /vu.z‿ave œ̃ ami/ (liaison)
    
2. _Il est très gentil._ — /il ɛ tʁɛ ʒɑ̃.ti/ (consonant clusters)
    

**Advanced (flow, intonation, reduction)**

1. _Si tu veux, nous irons demain matin._ — practise reduction _tu veux_ /ty vø/ → /tyvø/.
    
2. _Je ne sais pas ce qu'il veut dire._ — practice schwa dropping and liaison.
    

Each sentence: 1) read slowly with IPA, 2) read at normal speed, 3) record and compare.

---

# 15. Recording and feedback routine

1. Warm-up: 5 minutes of tongue/jaw/lip exercises.
    
2. Shadowing: listen to a short native clip (5–10s), then imitate exactly — repeat 10x.
    
3. Isolated drills: 10 minutes on minimal pairs.
    
4. Sentences: read and record 10 target sentences.
    
5. Compare: slow down native audio and compare waveform or spectral patterns if possible.
    

Tools: any recorder, Audacity for waveform inspection, Forvo or French podcasts for native samples.

---

# 16. Resources and next steps

**Listening sources:** news in slow French (News in Slow French), podcasts for learners, YouTube channels with slow, clear speech.

**Phonetics references:** a concise IPA chart, Forvo for word pronunciations, and native speaker shadowing.

**Syllabus suggestion:** 8-week plan: weeks 1–2 vowels & nasals, weeks 3–4 consonants & r, weeks 5–6 liaison & connected speech, weeks 7–8 fluency and advanced drills.
