## 1. **The Philosophy**

Toki Pona focuses on **simplicity and mindfulness**. It encourages thinking in **basic concepts** rather than complex, abstract ideas.

For example:

- Instead of “computer virus,” you might say **“ilo utala pi telo ike”** → “machine-fight of bad liquid” (literally “device-fight bad stuff”).
