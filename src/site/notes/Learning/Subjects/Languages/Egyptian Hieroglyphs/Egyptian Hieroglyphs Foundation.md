## 1. What Hieroglyphs Really Are (Get This Straight First)

Egyptian hieroglyphs are **not an alphabet like English**.

They are a **mixed writing system** made of three types of signs:

### 1. Phonograms (sound signs)

These represent **sounds**, not meanings.

- **Uniliteral** → 1 consonant (like an alphabet)
    
- **Biliteral** → 2 consonants
    
- **Triliteral** → 3 consonants
    

> Important: **Vowels are usually not written**.

Example:

- 🦉 = **m**
    
- 🐍 = **f**
    
- 🏠 = **pr** (“house”)
    

---

### 2. Ideograms (meaning signs)

These show **what the word is**.

- ☀️ = sun, day
    
- 👤 = man
    
- 🏠 = house
    

Sometimes the sign is followed by a **vertical stroke (|)** to say:  
“Read this as a thing, not a sound.”

---

### 3. Determinatives (meaning classifiers)

These are **silent**. They tell you _what category_ a word belongs to.

Example:

- A word about **walking** ends with 🚶
    
- A word about **thinking** ends with 🧠
    
- A word about **gods** ends with 👑
    

They are crucial for understanding meaning.

## 2. Direction: How to Read Hieroglyphs

Hieroglyphs can be written:

- Left → Right
    
- Right → Left
    
- Top → Bottom
    

### Rule:

👉 **Read toward the faces.**

If birds or people face left → read left  
If they face right → read right

This rule never fails.

## 3. The Core Alphabet (Uniliteral Signs)

You should **master these first**. This is your foundation.

|Sound|Sign|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|ꜣ|🦅|vulture|
|b|🦵|leg|
|p|🟦|stool|
|f|🐍|horned viper|
|m|🦉|owl|
|n|🌊|water|
|r|👄|mouth|
|h|🪢|twisted flax|
|ḥ|🏠|reed shelter|
|s|⚡|bolt|
|š|🏊|pool|
|k|🧺|basket|
|t|🍞|bread loaf|
|d|✋|hand|

If you know **these**, you can already read names.

## 4. Example: Reading a Real Word

### Word: **pr** (house)

Written as:

- 🏠 (pr)
    
- | (stroke → meaning “house”)
    

That’s it. Clean and logical.

## 5. Royal Names (Fun and Powerful)

### “Ramses” (Rꜥ-ms-sw)

- ☀️ (Ra – sun god)
    
- 🦉 (m)
    
- 🪑 (s)
    
- 🐣 (sw)
    

You’re already reading history.

---

## 6. Grammar Basics (No Sugar-Coating)

Egyptian grammar is **consonantal and compact**.

### Sentence order:

**Verb – Subject – Object**

Example:

- “Ate the man bread”
    
- Not: “The man ate bread”
    

### Plurals:

- Add **three strokes** (|||)
    

### Feminine words:

- End with **t** (🍞)

## 7. Scripts You Must Know

Hieroglyphs have **three forms**:

1. **Hieroglyphic** – monuments, temples
    
2. **Hieratic** – handwritten, fast
    
3. **Demotic** – very fast, late period
    

Start with **hieroglyphic only**.

---

## 8. How to Practice (Serious Method)

If you want real progress, do this:

### Daily (20–30 minutes)

1. Rewrite **10 uniliteral signs**
    
2. Read **royal names**
    
3. Translate **1 short inscription**
    

### Tools

- Gardiner’s Sign List (standard reference)
    
- JSesh (typing hieroglyphs)

## 9. Reality Check

This is **not** a weekend hobby language.  
It is:

- Logical
    
- Visual
    
- Pattern-heavy
    

Which actually suits **analytical minds** very well.
