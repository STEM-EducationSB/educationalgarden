## 1. Language Identity

- **Name (native):** Română
    
- **Family:** Indo-European → Romance → Eastern Romance
    
- **Closest relatives:** Italian (closest), Spanish, French
    
- **Unique trait:** Only major Romance language in Eastern Europe; strong Balkan influence
    

---

## 2. Alphabet & Pronunciation

Romanian uses the **Latin alphabet (31 letters)**.

### Special Letters (Critical)

|Letter|Sound|Example|
|---|---|---|
|ă|short neutral “uh”|măr (apple)|
|â / î|deep central vowel|România, în|
|ș|sh|școală|
|ț|ts|țară|

> **Rule:** â appears inside words, î at beginning/end.

Pronunciation is **mostly phonetic**—what you see is what you say.

---

## 3. Articles (Very Important Difference)

Romanian has **postposed definite articles** (attached to the noun).

|English|Romanian|
|---|---|
|a book|o carte|
|the book|cartea|
|books|cărți|
|the books|cărțile|

This is a **Balkan feature**, not Romance-standard. Master this early.

---

## 4. Nouns & Gender

### Genders (3, not 2)

- **Masculine**
    
- **Feminine**
    
- **Neuter** (acts masculine in singular, feminine in plural)
    

Example:

- un hotel → hotelul (sg, masculine)
    
- două hoteluri (pl, feminine behavior)
    

Plural forms are **not predictable**—must be memorized.

---

## 5. Personal Pronouns

|Person|Pronoun|
|---|---|
|I|eu|
|you (sg)|tu|
|he|el|
|she|ea|
|we|noi|
|you (pl)|voi|
|they|ei / ele|

Romanian is **pro-drop**: pronouns are often omitted.

---

## 6. Verbs – Core System

### Infinitive Endings

Most verbs end in:

- **-a** (a vorbi – to speak)
    
- **-e** (a merge – to go)
    
- **-i / -î** (a veni – to come)
    

### Present Tense (example: _a vorbi_)

|Person|Form|
|---|---|
|eu|vorbesc|
|tu|vorbești|
|el/ea|vorbește|
|noi|vorbim|
|voi|vorbiți|
|ei/ele|vorbesc|

Verb conjugation is **richer than Spanish**, but logical.

---

## 7. Past Tense (Essential)

Romanian prefers **Perfect Compus** for everyday speech.

Structure:

> **present of “a avea” + past participle**

Example:

- am mâncat – I ate
    
- ai văzut – you saw
    
- a venit – he came
    

Simple past exists but is **regional/literary**.

---

## 8. Word Order

Default:

> **Subject – Verb – Object**

But Romanian is **flexible** due to cases and emphasis.

Example:

- Eu citesc cartea.
    
- Cartea o citesc eu. (emphasis)
    

---

## 9. Cases (Light but Present)

Romanian retains **case remnants**:

- Nominative / Accusative
    
- Genitive / Dative
    

Example:

- cartea elevului – the student’s book
    
- dau cartea elevului – I give the book to the student
    

Not as heavy as German or Slavic—but not gone.

---

## 10. Vocabulary Layers

Romanian vocabulary sources:

- **Latin** (core): apă, timp, mare
    
- **Slavic**: prieten, drag
    
- **Turkish**: ceai, ciorbă
    
- **French (modern)**: birou, școală
    

This explains why Romanian can feel **Italian + Slavic**.

---

## 11. Difficulty Profile (Realistic)

For you, Romanian is:

- **Easier than Polish or Serbian**
    
- **Harder than Spanish**
    
- Comparable to **Italian with extra grammar**
    

Main challenges:

1. Postposed articles
    
2. Gender + plural chaos
    
3. Pronunciation of â / î
    

---

## 12. Strategic Learning Order (Recommended)

1. Alphabet + sounds
    
2. Definite articles
    
3. Present tense verbs
    
4. Perfect Compus
    
5. Plurals & gender patterns
    
6. Prepositions + cases
